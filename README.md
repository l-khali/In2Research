# In2Research Project: Statistical analysis of critical slowing down post extubation in intensive care units

Natural systems undergo sudden transitions due a variety of reasons. A critical slowing down of system dynamics has been shown to occur prior to certain types of sudden transitions, and has been observed in various natural phenomena. This critical slowing down can be captured as an increase in quantifiers, such as the variance and autocorrelation, in the system response, prior to the transition. Specifically, this has been observed prior to critical transitions in time series data of various physiological processes. 

In a complex biological system, critical slowing down indicates lower resilience to perturbations experienced by the system. Thus the shift from a "normal" to a "critical" state can occur more easily. A specific case in intensive care units (ICUs) concerns individuals who require mechanical ventilation. A subsection of these patients fail extubation (removal of mechanical ventillation) and require re-intubation within 48 hours. We will compare the dynamics of the physiological measurements post-extubation of these patients to those who did not require re-intubation. We examine whether, in the period leading up to re-intubation, there is evidence of critical slowing down in the heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure.
